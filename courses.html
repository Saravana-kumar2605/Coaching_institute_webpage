        <h3>About Priming course</h3>
        <p>Priming is a futuristic and more specialised course designed for students in classes VI and VII to give a flavour of the competitive exams, which they will encounter in their career pursuit. Orientation program has always been there for a very long time, be it any under-graduate/post-graduate studies or in the workplace, as it is crucial to know what we are going to deal with during the process. Similar to that, our Priming course essentially exposes the student to the potential skill set that one must possess to emerge successful in academic pursuits.

            There are overall few basic skills necessary to understand and excel in any field of study, viz., reading, communication, numerical, analytical, comprehensive and problem-solving skills. Also, we believe that prior to getting into any subject, it is necessary for a student to know how to approach a subject to learn and understand the concepts better, in real time. This course is designed to serve these purposes where a student will be trained in different facets to cultivate these skills in him/her by empirical means.</p>
        <h3>About Foundation course</h3>    
        <p>Foundation is an intensive curriculum drafted for students in classes VIII to X to learn the basic concepts, which are important to face pre-medical and pre-engineering exams in their future. As the name suggests, the course is intended to provide more subject-specific clarity in fundamental concepts, which will aid them in their future career endeavours. All the fundamental theories are taught explicitly to make them dwell on the concepts sufficiently long enough to imbibe the concepts in depth. We will be focussing on physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology, along with the basic comprehensive, analytical and problem-solving skills essential to attain their career dreams. The essence of each subject will be delivered with the professional touch. Students will be rigorously trained with several assessments and assignments to acquaint them with the coursework methodology largely followed in IITs.</p>
